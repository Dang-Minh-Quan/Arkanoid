##  Description

**Arkanoid Game** is a classic brick-breaker game developed in **Java** as the **final project** for the *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* course.  
The project demonstrates the practical application of **OOP principles** and **design patterns** in a real-world interactive game.

---

Key Features

- Developed using **Java 17+** with **JavaFX/Swing** for GUI  
- Implements all major **OOP principles**:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
- Applies multiple **Design Patterns**:
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method
  - Strategy
  - Observer
  - State
- Supports **Multithreading** for smooth gameplay and responsive UI  
- Includes **sound effects**, **animations**, and **power-up systems**  
- Features **Save/Load Game** functionality and **Leaderboard System**

---

Game Mechanics

- Control the **paddle** to bounce the **ball** and destroy bricks  
- **Collect power-ups** for temporary abilities  
- Progress through **multiple levels** with increasing difficulty  
- Score points and **compete on the leaderboard**

## Design Patterns Implementation

### Singleton Pattern
**Used in:** `MainMedia`, `MainImage`  
**Purpose:** Ensure only one instance exists throughout the application.

### Factory Pattern
**Used in:** `Factory (GameObject)`, `Product (Ball, Paddle, Brick)`  
**Purpose:** Dynamically create different game objects.

---

## Multithreading Implementation

The game utilizes multiple threads to ensure smooth and stable performance:

| Thread | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| Game Loop Thread | Updates game logic at 60 FPS |
| Audio Thread Pool | Plays sound effects asynchronously |
| PowerUpManager Thread | Manages and stops power-up effects |

---

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|---------|
| ← or A | Move paddle left |
| → or D | Move paddle right |
| SPACE | Launch ball |
| P | Pause/Resume game |

---

## How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Click **"New Game"** from the main menu  
2. **Control the paddle**: Move using arrow keys or **A/D**  
3. **Launch the ball**: Press **SPACE**  
4. **Destroy bricks**: Bounce the ball to hit and break bricks  
5. **Collect power-ups**: Catch falling power-ups to gain abilities  
6. **Avoid losing the ball**: Prevent it from falling below the paddle  
7. **Complete the level**: Break all destructible bricks to advance  

---

## Power-ups

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 🧱 Long Paddle | Increases paddle width for 10 seconds |
| 🔫 Gun Paddle | Shoot bullets to destroy bricks for 10 seconds |
| 💥 Explosive Ball | Explodes in a 3×3 area for 10 seconds |
| 🔮 Infinity Ball | Makes the ball indestructible for 5 seconds |
| ⚽ Multi Ball | Spawns 1 additional ball |
| 💰 Bonus Point | Adds 50 bonus points |

---

## Scoring System

| Action | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Destroy a brick | +10 |
| Collect power-up | +50 |
| Each remaining life | +20 bonus |
